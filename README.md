- Hi, I’m @ckarizona1 and I am 19 years old. 
- I started programming during quarantine last year for fun and decided to pursue a career in Tech.
- I’m interested in Python automation, using API's, and data visualization.
- I’m currently at Arizona State University and plan to graduate in 2025.
- How to reach me ... DM me I think? I'm new to Github, currently learning.
